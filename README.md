The GitHub CI/CD pipeline
Here are some steps to create a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions: 
Create or choose a repository and select a project
Open GitHub Actions in the repository to start building the CI/CD workflow
Make changes to the code to trigger the CI/CD pipeline
GitHub Actions offers workflows that can build the code in the repository and run tests. Workflows can run on GitHub-hosted virtual machines or on machines that the user hosts themselves. 
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. All GitHub repositories come with Actions enabled by default.
