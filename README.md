A CI/CD pipeline is a mechanism that automatically starts the build process, runs tests, and deploys to the production environment when a team member pushes a change to the shared repo.

## The stages of a CI/CD pipeline are

* _Build: Compile the code_
* _Test: Test the code_
* _Release: Release the application in the GitHub repository_
* _Deployment: Deploy the application to the production       environment_
  
**GitHub Actions uses workflows to achieve CI/CD. A workflow is an automated process that runs one or more jobs.**

>GitHub Actions is fully integrated with GitHub, so any webhook can be set as an even trigger for an automation or CI/CD pipeline.

CI/CD is a DevOps process that focuses on creating a compatible blend between the development cycle and the operations process. This is done by automating workflows and rolling out automatic updates to improve ROI.
